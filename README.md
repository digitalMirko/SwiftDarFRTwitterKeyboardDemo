Swift - Dark Theme First Responder Twitter Keyboard w/ Swipe Down Dismiss Demo 8 of 30

App created in Xcode 10.3 (10G8) using Swift 4.2, iOS Deployment Target 12.4 and tested on a iPhone Xr Emulator

In this demo app we demonstrate how to code a swift Dark Twitter Keyboard Themed First Responder Demo app with a downward 
gesture setup to dismiss the keyboard that automatically pops up as the app starts without having to touch the textview.

When the user clicks the icon they are taken right into the app. They are greeted with the title on top 'Dark Theme FR Twitter
Keyboard Demo". Then right below in the body is a large TextView area with the dark themed Twitter keyboard automatically 
popping for the user to use. The user types in their text and with a down swipe gesture the keyboard is dismissed. 

This demo shows how in code you can change the color of the keyboard to dark and the theme to a Twitter keyboard. Also, 
it is setup so the keyboard automatically pops up because the starting view is setup as a First Responder. Then to dismiss
the keyboard a gesture in a downward motion is added which pulls the keyboard back down until called again to be used.
